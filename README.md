# Barnes-Hut-Simulator

The Barnes-Hut Algorithm describes an effective method for solving n-body problems. It was originally published in 1986 by Josh Barnes and Piet Hut. Instead of directly summing up all forces, it is using a tree based approximation scheme which reduces the computational complexity of the problem from O(N2) to O(N log N). This repository belongs to an article on [beltoforion.de](https://beltoforion.de/en) explaining the Barnes-Hut algorithm.
